# SQL_Pizza_Sales
In this project, I utilized SQL to perform in-depth analysis on a pizza sales dataset, focusing on customer behavior, product performance, and overall sales trends. The analysis aimed to uncover key insights that can inform pricing strategies, marketing decisions, and inventory management for a pizza business.
